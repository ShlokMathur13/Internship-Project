oo# HTML Projects

## Overview
Welcome to the HTML Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of HTML projects that I have developed as part of my ongoing practice in web development. The projects here cover a range of fundamental concepts in HTML, along with some CSS and JavaScript for added functionality.

## Features
- **Basic HTML Structure**: Demonstrates the use of basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
- **Forms and Inputs**: Includes examples of creating forms with different input types, validation, and submission handling.
- **CSS Styling**: Incorporates basic CSS for styling, including layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid.
- **Interactive Elements**: Uses JavaScript for adding interactivity to the web pages, such as event handling and DOM manipulation.

## Repository Structure
The repository is organized into different directories, each corresponding to a specific project or concept. Here's an overview of the structure:
